# About:
This game will be a huge step in the right direction for me, as I will publish this game, update it, and add so many
features that just might set this game apart. But still it is gonna be such a huge learning expirence! So strap in, as
we make a game that just might become somthing more that a dream/idea.

# Features:
The features we currently have:
GLFW window (Status:👍),
GLFW API Integration (Status:👍),
Object Oriented Programming to the next level (Status:👍),
Code Compatibility (Status:76%),
Model loading (Status:23%)

The features we DON'T have:
Asteroids appearing,
Asteroid collision,
Game objective,
Win possibility

# Closing Statement:
If you actually took the time to read whatever this "README.md" is,
than WOW you ...actually care... So this game will probably be working
soon...
